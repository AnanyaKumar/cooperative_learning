In this project, we investigate cooperative play. Multiple cars, with the same policy, are trying to cooperate to drive to reach the finish line, while avoiding obstacles. For more details, see our proposal.

## Code policies

Make your changes in a separate branch, and then submit a pull request to merge with master. At least one other project member should read through the changes and validate them before you merge.

Focus on checking correctness when reviewing. Include comments for each function and class, and for tricky parts of the code. Style is a lower priority, follow https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html if possible, but it's not really important for the current scale of the project.
